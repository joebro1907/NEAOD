# NEIOD
A modern and open implementation of Gauss's method for the Initial Orbit Determination of Near-Earth Objects (Minor Planets)

The code requires the following Python packages:

Numpy,
Scipy,
Astropy,
Astroquery,
Matplotlib,
Poliastro (own forked version),
Pandas

## What the project does:
The project is focused on celestial mechanics and orbital calculations. It involves functions for handling observational data, calculating positions, implementing Gauss' method for orbit determination, calculating orbital elements, solving Kepler's equation, and plotting orbits using Python and related libraries such as NumPy, pandas, astropy, Matplotlib, and Poliastro.

## Why the project is useful:
This project is valuable for researchers, astronomers, and anyone interested in celestial mechanics and orbital dynamics. It provides tools and functions to analyze observational data, determine orbits of celestial objects, calculate orbital elements, and visualize orbits, which are essential tasks in the study of celestial bodies.

## How users can get started with the project:
Install Required Libraries: Users need to have Python installed on their system along with the necessary libraries such as NumPy, pandas, astropy, Matplotlib, and Poliastro. They can install these libraries using pip if they are not already installed:
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas astropy matplotlib poliastro
Download the Code: Users can download the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks containing the project code from a repository or directly from where it's hosted.
Read Documentation and Examples: Users should read the project documentation and examples provided to understand how to use the functions and scripts effectively. This includes understanding the input parameters, expected data formats, and the expected output.
Experiment and Modify: Users can start by experimenting with the provided examples, modifying parameters, and input data to see how the functions behave and how they can be adapted for their specific needs.

##Where users can get help with your project:
Documentation: The project should include detailed documentation explaining the purpose of each function, the expected inputs and outputs, and examples of usage.
Online Communities: Users can seek help from online communities such as Stack Overflow, where they can ask specific questions and get assistance from the community.
GitHub Repository Issues: If the project is hosted on GitHub, users can check the repository's issue tracker for known issues, discussions, and solutions to common problems.
Contact the Maintainer: Users can directly contact the maintainer or contributors of the project if they encounter issues or have specific questions not covered by the documentation.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project:
The project is likely maintained and contributed to by a team or individual developers interested in celestial mechanics, astronomy, and Python programming. The maintainer or contributors would be listed in the project's documentation or on the repository's page if it's hosted on platforms like GitHub. Users can reach out to them for support, contributions, or to report issues.
